# Competitive Programming: A Journey in Progress üöÄ

Welcome to my competitive programming repository!

This repository is a log towards my journey into the world of competitive programming. Recently, I‚Äôve discovered how rewarding this pursuit can be, and I‚Äôve started taking it seriously as a hobby. My purpose of creating this repository is to develop consistency, challenge myself with problems as they gets harder, and steadily improve my problem-solving skills.

## Why This Repository?

Before diving into Codeforces, I spent time solving problems on LeetCode, which helped me build foundational programming skills and develop an appreciation for structured problem-solving. However, as I sought a more dynamic and challenging environment, I turned to Codeforces, which pushed me to think more critically and deeply about algorithms and implementation.

This repository serves two purposes:

1. **Tracking Progress**: It‚Äôs a log of my learning journey. By storing my solutions here, I can revisit them, reflect on my growth, and identify areas for improvement.
2. **Consistency and Contribution**: This repository is my commitment to maintaining a regular practice schedule. By sharing my work, I also hope to contribute to the competitive programming community by providing examples and insights that others may find helpful.

## My Goals

1. **Consistency**: Competitive programming is a skill that requires regular practice and consistency. This repository is my way of holding my honest accountability towards that goal.
2. **Growth**: While I‚Äôm currently exploring the breadth of competitive programming, I look forward to delving deeper into specific concepts and problem types over time.
3. **Community Contribution**: Sharing my solutions and journey allows me to give back to the community that has inspired me and provided valuable resources along the way.

## What‚Äôs Next?

This is just the beginning of a journey that I hope will lead to mastery in computational thinking and problem-solving. I plan to participate in more contests, tackle diverse problem sets, and gradually build my understanding of algorithms, optimization techniques, and other advanced topics.

If you‚Äôre on a similar journey, feel free to browse my repository, share feedback, or connect with me to discuss ideas or collaborate.
